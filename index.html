<p class="aboutme">
	I strive to accomplish my goals of being a successful everyday. I am also well-talented in communication, photography, problem solving, and thinking outside the box. I've worked many different jobs, which has helped broaden my skills and talents. I graduated from Utah State University in May 2016 with a Bachelor's degree in English, Creative Writing emphasis. I always strive to work above and beyond expectations and am a quick learner. I adapt well to new situations and work well independently and in a group setting. I believe that hard work reaps benefits for the self and the employer. My life goal is to be a successful author, but I love to share my talents and personality in every job I work. I am currently intensively studying web development throught the University of Utah.

<p class="aboutme"> 
	I may never become a hero in this life but if I can write a story, create characters, and inspire role models then my talents would shine to those around me. My goal is to use the gifts and talents I have been blessed with to help inspire people, young and old, and send them on epic adventures; to give them someone to look up to, similar to my childhood heroes
